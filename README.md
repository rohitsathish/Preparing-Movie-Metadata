# Preparing-Movie-Metadata

As part of a project to analyze and visualize movie metadata, I wanted to answer the questions:
1. Which are the most successful and profitable production houses?
2. Which are the most popular and profitable genres?

The dataset I used involved the metadata file in [this Kaggle repository](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv). However the data needed to be cleaned and prepared before it could be visualized and that is the notebook that has been uploaded here.

The final vizualization was created using Tableau and can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/rohit1781#!/vizhome/Udacity-Moviesdataset/EDAProfit).
